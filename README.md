# yaynay
A dummy project integrating one tap login by [Sawo Labs](https://sawolabs.com/). 
[Web app here](https://yay-nay.herokuapp.com/)

## What it does.
- You will see as soon as you open the page there is a `yay` and a `nay`.
- With each login, the user gets to vote for either of those. The count reflects how many users have randomly voted for either of them.
- A user only gets to vote randomly once. If the user is logging in for a second time they will be prompted that they can't vote.

## What I learnt
- I had never made even a basic react app. This is the first time doing so.
- I had never hosted both frontend and backend on the same server.
- Using sawo login for the first time.
- Working with environment variables and heroku, not very straightforward.
- TS >>>> JS

## Tech stack
- React for frontend
- Node for backend
- Sawo email auth for authentication
- Firebase for backend
- Heroku to deploy
